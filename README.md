# TailwindCSS Crash Course

I am following a crash course on building a landing page using tailwindcss (course taught by BradTraversy)

The Finished landing page : https://egidehirwa.github.io/tailwindcss-landing-page/

The YouTube tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFgzHOX84xQ

The aim of this course is to get up to speed with tailwindcss because we will be using it for our group project at BeCode.

## Step 1 - Code-along completed

I have completed the tutorial and everything works fine
The next step will be to add some customizations on the design

## What l learned

- Tailwindcss is cool and not as ugly as l thought it would be in the html
- It's very effective and l see how it can speed up the design process
- No need to try and memorize the class names
- Learned how to add custom css in a tailwindcss project
- Learned how to crate an animated hamburger menu

## Where do l go from here ?

I still need to practice tailwindcss so l'll choose some designs to replicate and either create new pages or publish them as standalone sites.

Frontend mentors is a good place to find these designs.
